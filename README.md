# web322-assignment

This is the final assignment for my WEB322 course. Using express handlebars, I was to make a food ordering website. 
Through the use of cookies, users can sign up and log in, with usernames and passwords being stored on MongoDB. Passwords are encrypted. 
Users can add items to their cart and click the order button to have an email sent to them with their order.
An admin account exists that can delete items from the store or add new items.
